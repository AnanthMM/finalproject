# Crossing America: Phylogenetics of Two Plethodontid Salamander Genera Across Their Highly Fragmented Ranges

## Introduction and Goals

Plethodontidae is a diverse group of salamanders with most of their diversity located in North America, specifically east of the Great Plains in the United States, along the West Coast of the United States, and in the mountainous ranges of central and southern Mexico (AmphibiaWeb 2020). Members of Plethodontidae are lungless, and depend on moist conditions to survive; this combined with their small size (most species reach under 15 cm in length) greatly constrains their ability to disperse over large distances. Two genera, *Aneides* and *Plethodon*, have representatives both on the West Coast and east of the Great Plains, regions which are seperated by wide expanses of dry, highly unsuitable habitat for Plethodontids. Even more surprisingly, a single species in each genus is also present in isolated mountain ranges in New Mexico (*Aneides hardii* and *Plethodon neomexicanus*); similar, seemingly-suitable habitat is present in other nearby mountain ranges in New Mexico, and much more extensively in the Colorado Rockies to the north and the Sierra Madre Occidental to the southwest, yet neither genus has been documented in these areas in spite of extensive collecting by herpetologists (Petranka 2010). *Plethodon* and *Aneides* are each believed to be monophyletic, and they are not believed to be sister taxa (Vieites et al. 2011), yet no other genus in Plethodontidae is present in more than one of the three hotspots described above (eastern US, West Coast, southern/central Mexico), and no Plethodontids at all are found west of central Texas and the Great Plains, and east of the Great Basin and the Idaho Rockies, besides the aforementioned two species (Petranka 2010).
The goal of my project is to better understand the evolutionary history of these two oddly-distributed genera. Specifically, I would like to verify that Aneides and Plethodon are truly each monophyletic as they are currently understood to be, and if they are, I would like to understand how each genus expanded across North America, by examining the phylogenetic relationships between the eastern, western, and New Mexican representatives of each genus. This would provide insight as to whether the New Mexican species are each relics of a more widespread distribution of Plethodontids across North America, or whether they represent radiations from either coast.

## Methods

I obtained publicly-available DNA sequences for two genes, ND-4 (mitochondrial) and Rag-1 (nuclear) from the NCBI database for *Aneides hardii*, *Plethodon neomexicanus*, several representatives of each of *Aneides* and *Plethodon* from both their eastern and western distributions, a number of outgroups within Plethodontidae including species which range relatively far north in Mexico (*Aquiloeurycea galeanae*, *Isthmura bellii*), and one outgroup from outside of Plethodontidae (*Amphiuma tridactylum*). I created a maximum-likelihood gene tree for each of these genes using IQ-TREE, with a bootstrap sample of 1000 to generate support values. I also generated a third tree by inputting the direct concatenation of these two genes into IQ-TREE with the specifications described above, and a fourth tree using a partition model with a partition specified between the two genes concatenated, and the same substitution model as chosen in the concatenation analysis without partition.

## Results

Below is the gene tree generated for the ND-4 gene.
```{r fig.width=12, fig.height=20, echo=FALSE}

phy = read.tree("NADH_ML_bootstrap/NADH.aligned.fasta.treefile")
plot(phy)
nodelabels(phy$node.label)

```
This tree suggests that western members of *Aneides* form a monophyletic group, with *Aneides hardii* sister to this group, and the eastern *Aneides aeneus* sister to the rest of the genus. It suggests that all western members of *Plethodon* form a monophyletic group, with *Plethodon neomexicanus* nested within this group, while all eastern members of *Plethodon* sampled form a monophyletic group sister to much of Plethodontidae.

Support values for edges close to the tips were generally high, with relationships within smaller clades reflecting those presented by previously published phylogenies (e.g. eastern *Plethodon* in Fisher-Reid 2011). However, support values for edges between larger clades (e.g. Plethodontidae excluding western *Plethodon* and *Ensatina*) were very poor. In particular, the polyphyly of *Plethodon*, the monophyly of western *Plethodon*, and the placement of *Plethodon neomexicanus* within the clade of western *Plethodon* are poorly supported, and the monophyly of *Aneides* excluding the eastern species *Aneides aeneus* is also not well-supported.
Relationships between larger clades (e.g. genera) in this gene tree greatly contradict established relationships between Plethodontid genera (Vieites et al. 2011).

Below is the gene tree generated for the Rag-1 gene.
```{r fig.width=12, fig.height=20, echo=FALSE}

phy = read.tree("Rag-1_ML_bootstrap/Rag-1.aligned.fasta.treefile")
plot(phy)
nodelabels(phy$node.label)

```
This tree suggests that western members of *Aneides* form a monophyletic group, with *Aneides hardii* sister to this group, and the eastern *Aneides aeneus* sister to the rest of the genus. It suggests that all western members of *Plethodon* form a monophyletic group, with *Plethodon neomexicanus* nested within this group, and eastern members of *Plethodon* form a monophyletic group sister to the aformentioned clade of western and New Mexican *Plethodon*.
This tree also suggests that *Plethodon* and *Aneides* are each monophyletic as entire genera.

Unlike the ND-4 tree, support values in the Rag-1 tree are high for most edges close to the root of the tree, and relationships between genera are more consistent with established relationships between Plethodontid genera (Vieites et al. 2011). The monophyly of western *Aneides*, the placement of *Aneides hardii* as sister to western *Aneides*, and the placement of the eastern *Aneides aeneus* as sister the the rest of *Aneides* (and hence the monophyly of *Aneides*) are all well-supported. The monophyly of *Plethodon* and the monophyly of the group of eastern *Plethodon* are highly supported, and the monophyly of the group of western and New Mexican *Plethodon* is somewhat well-supported, but the placement of *Plethodon neomexicanus* as nested within the western *Plethodon* is not well-supported.

Below is the gene tree generated for the concatenation of the two genes with no partition specified.
```{r fig.width=12, fig.height=20, echo=FALSE}

phy = read.tree("Concatenated_bootstrap/NADH+Rag-1.aligned.fasta.treefile")
plot(phy)
nodelabels(phy$node.label)

```
In this tree, the monophyly of *Aneides* and *Plethodon* are each well-supported, and predicted relationships within these genera are very similar to those in the Rag-1 tree, with similar support values.
As in the Rag-1 tree, relationships between larger clades were mostly consistent with previously published phylogenies (Vieites et al. 2011).

Finally, below is the gene tree generated for the concatenation of the two genes with a partition specified between the two genes.
```{r fig.width=12, fig.height=20, echo=FALSE}

phy = read.tree("Concatenated_bootstrap/NADH+Rag-1.partitions.treefile")
plot(phy)
nodelabels(phy$node.label)

```
This tree has the exact same topology as the tree for the concatenation of the two genes with no partition, but with lower support values in a couple key areas, in particular regarding the relationships between western *Plethodon* and *Plethodon neomexicanus*.

## Discussion

The Rag-1 tree and combined trees demonstrate with high support the monophyly of each of *Plethodon* and *Aneides*. This suggest that the two present-day Plethodontids in New Mexico are indeed the result of multiple seperate Plethodontid radiations into the region. The monophyly of these two genera also indicates a shared ancestry between the New Mexican Plethodontids and either eastern or western clades, not Mexican clades of Plethodontids such as *Isthamura*, *Aquiloeurycea*, and *Pseudoeurycea*.

Strongly-supported relationships in the Rag-1 and concatenated trees (and moderate-to-weakly supported relationships in the ND-4 tree) suggest that *Aneides hardii* is sister to the group of western *Aneides*, with eastern *Aneides* sister to this broader group. This could either mean that *Aneides hardii* is the result of a radiation of *Aneides* from the west coast before the diversification of that group, or it could mean *Aneides hardii* diverged from the ancestor of present-day western *Aneides* when the genus had a more widespread distribution across the American west, perhaps soon after the ancestor of the eastern *Aneides aeneus* diverged from the ancestor of the rest of the genus's extant members.

Strongly-supported relationships in all four trees indicate that the group of eastern *Plethodon* is monophyletic, and does not include *Plethodon neomexicanus*, ruling out the possibiliy of *Plethodon neomexicanus* being the result of a recent radiation from the east, and there is strong support in the concatenation trees for a monophyletic group consisting of western *Plethodon* together with *Plethodon neomexicanus*. Weakly-supported relationships that are consistent in all four trees suggest that *Plethodon neomexicanus* is nested within the clade of western *Plethodon*; if we accept this relationship, then *Plethodon neomexicanus* is likely the result of a radiation of *Plethodon* from the west that occurred after some of the diversification of extant *Plethodon* in the Pacific Northwest. However, stronger support would be required to make this conclusion.

The ideal, thorough way to address this research question would be to construct a Baysian time-calibrated tree with fossil data. Knowing the absolute times of divergence of the New Mexican, eastern, and western clades of *Plethodon* and *Aneides* would allow us to better understand the climatic conditions under which these radiations were able to occur accross large areas which are now inhospitable to Plethodontid salamanders. Past research indicates that the two genera diverged from related genera during the Eocene after the closure of the western interior seaway (Vieites et al. 2008). Since then, as the ancestors of extant species of *Plethodon* and *Aneides* diverged, the climate of the western United States has flutuated between periods of higher and lower rainfall, providing opportunites for Plethodontids to disperse across areas of the American west that now serve as barriers to them.
