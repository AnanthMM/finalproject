## Guidelines - you can delete this section before submission

This repository is a stub for your final project. Fork it, develop your project, and submit it as a pull request. Edit/ delete the text in this readme as needed.

Some guidelines and tips:

- Use the stubs below to write up your final project. Alternatively, if you would like the writeup to be an executable document (with [knitr](http://yihui.name/knitr/), [jupytr](http://jupyter.org/), or other tools), you can create it as a separate file and put a link to it here in the readme.

- For information on formatting text files with markdown, see https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/ . You can use markdown to include images in this document by linking to files in the repository, eg `![GitHub Logo](/images/logo.png)`.

- The project must be entirely reproducible. In addition to the results, the repository must include all the data (or links to data) and code needed to reproduce the results.

- If you are working with unpublished data that you would prefer not to publicly share at this time, please contact me to discuss options. In most cases, the data can be anonymized in a way that putting them in a public repo does not compromise your other goals.

- Paste references (including urls) into the reference section, and cite them with the general format (Smith at al. 2003).

- Commit and push often as you work.

OK, here we go.

# Crossing America: Phylogenetics of Two Plethodontid Salamander Genera Across Their Highly Fragmented Ranges

## Introduction and Goals

Plethodontidae is a diverse group of salamanders with most of their diversity located in North America, specifically east of the Great Plains in the United States, along the West Coast of the United States, and in the mountainous ranges of central and southern Mexico (AmphibiaWeb 2020). Members of Plethodontidae are lungless, and depend on moist conditions to survive; this combined with their small size (most species reach under 15 cm in length) greatly constrains their ability to disperse over large distances. Two genera, $Aneides$ and $Plethodon$, have representatives both on the West Coast and east of the Great Plains, regions which are seperated by wide expanses of dry, highly unsuitable habitat for Plethodontids. Even more surprisingly, a single species in each genus is also present in isolated mountain ranges in New Mexico ($Aneides\ hardii$ and $Plethodon\ neomexicanus$); similar, seemingly-suitable habitat is present in other nearby mountain ranges in New Mexico, and much more extensively in the Colorado Rockies to the north and the Sierra Madre Occidental to the southwest, yet neither genus has been documented in these areas in spite of extensive collecting by herpetologists (Petranka 2010). $Plethodon$ and $Aneides$ are each believed to be monophyletic, and they are not believed to be sister taxa (Vieites et al. 2011), yet no other genus in Plethodontidae is present in more than one of the three hotspots described above (eastern US, West Coast, southern/central Mexico), and no Plethodontids at all are found west of central Texas and the Great Plains, and east of the Great Basin and the Idaho Rockies, besides the aforementioned two species (Petranka 2010).
The goal of my project is to better understand the evolutionary history of these two oddly-distributed genera. Specifically, I would like to verify that Aneides and Plethodon are truly each monophyletic as they are currently understood to be, and if they are, I would like to understand how each genus expanded across North America, by examining the phylogenetic relationships between the eastern, western, and New Mexican representatives of each genus. This would provide insight as to whether the New Mexican species are each relics of a more widespread distribution of Plethodontids across North America, or whether they represent radiations from either coast.

## Methods

I obtained publicly-available DNA sequences for two genes, ND-4 (mitochondrial) and Rag-1 (nuclear) from the NCBI database for $Aneides\ hardii$, $Plethodon\ neomexicanus$, several representatives of each of $Aneides$ and $Plethodon$ from both their eastern and western distributions, a number of outgroups within Plethodontidae including species which range relatively far north in Mexico ($Aquiloeurycea\ galeanae$, $Isthmura\ bellii$), and one outgroup from outside of Plethodontidae ($Amphiuma\ tridactylum$). I created a maximum-likelihood gene tree for each of these genes using IQ-TREE, with a bootstrap sample of 1000 to generate support values. I also generated a third tree by inputting the direct concatenation of these two genes into IQ-TREE with the specifications described above.

## Results

Below is the gene tree generated for the ND-4 gene.
```{r fig.width=12, fig.height=20, echo=FALSE}

phy = read.tree("NADH_ML_bootstrap/NADH.alignment.fasta.treefile")
plot(phy)
nodelabels(phy$node.label)

```


Below is the gene tree generated for the Rag-1 gene.
```{r fig.width=12, fig.height=20, echo=FALSE}

phy = read.tree("Rag-1_ML_bootstrap/Rag-1.alignment.fasta.treefile")
plot(phy)
nodelabels(phy$node.label)

```


Finally, below is the gene tree generated for the concatenation of the two genes.
```{r fig.width=12, fig.height=20, echo=FALSE}

phy = read.tree("Concatenated_bootstrap/NADH+Rag-1.alignment.fasta.treefile")
plot(phy)
nodelabels(phy$node.label)

```

## Discussion

This phylogeny places Plethodon neomexicanus as nested within the clade of western Plethodon. This would suggest that Plethodon neomexicanus arose in its current distribution as a result of a radiation from the northwestern United States that occurred after (and seperately from) the dispersal event of Plethodon from one coast to the other. The phylogeny places Aneides hardii as sister to all western Aneides species, with Aneides aeneus, the one eastern Aneides sampled, placed as sister to all other Aneides. This suggests that Aneides hardii is the product of a radiation from the west coast that occurred after the split between Aneides aeneus and the western members of Aneides. In short, this preliminary analysis suggests that neither species is the relic of the dispersal event which allowed each of the two genera to exist on both coasts. The topology of small subclades of the tree close to the tips pretty closely matches that of published phylogenies of Plethodontidae (e.g. http://ibdev.mcb.berkeley.edu/labs/wake/373_multigenic_Plethodontidae.pdf and https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Combined-data-Plethodon-phylogeny-Phylogeny-of-the-salamander-genus-Plethodon-based-on-a_fig1_51717349), meaning that it's placement of Plethodon neomexicanus and Aneides hardii within the western clade of Plethodon and within Aneides respectively may be trusted to some degree.

This phylogeny also suggests, more controversially, that the genus Plethodon is paraphyletic, with all eastern Plethodon falling in a clade that is sister to a large portion of Plethodontidae, including genera limited to the east coast (Desmognathus, Phaeognathus, Eurycea, Pseudotriton), the west coast (Hydromantes), and Mexico and Central America (Isthamura, Aquiloeurycea). According to this result, there was no radiation of the genus Plethodon across the United States; instead, there was a divergence between eastern Plethodon and most other Plethodontids, which some of the genera in the remaining clade dispersing across the United States or into Mexico. This not only seem less believable becuase it would require several independent massive dispresal events across varied habitat and large distances, but it also goes against published family-level phylogenies of Plethodontidae. I suspect that ~800 base pairs is not sufficient to work out the order of the ancient and rapid series of divergences which resulted in the present-day (genus-level, if we are to belive current taxonomy) diversity of Plethodontidae. Going forward, I will search for more genes for which there is available data for Plethodon neomexicanus and Aneides hardii, preferably with many more base pairs, in order to construct a more certain phylogeny. I will also think about how I could make more concious choices about the model I use to gain more reliable results.
