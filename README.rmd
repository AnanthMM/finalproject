## Guidelines - you can delete this section before submission

This repository is a stub for your final project. Fork it, develop your project, and submit it as a pull request. Edit/ delete the text in this readme as needed.

Some guidelines and tips:

- Use the stubs below to write up your final project. Alternatively, if you would like the writeup to be an executable document (with [knitr](http://yihui.name/knitr/), [jupytr](http://jupyter.org/), or other tools), you can create it as a separate file and put a link to it here in the readme.

- For information on formatting text files with markdown, see https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/ . You can use markdown to include images in this document by linking to files in the repository, eg `![GitHub Logo](/images/logo.png)`.

- The project must be entirely reproducible. In addition to the results, the repository must include all the data (or links to data) and code needed to reproduce the results.

- If you are working with unpublished data that you would prefer not to publicly share at this time, please contact me to discuss options. In most cases, the data can be anonymized in a way that putting them in a public repo does not compromise your other goals.

- Paste references (including urls) into the reference section, and cite them with the general format (Smith at al. 2003).

- Commit and push often as you work.

OK, here we go.

# Crossing America: Phylogenetics of Two Plethodontid Salamander Genera Across Their Highly Fragmented Ranges

## Introduction and Goals

Plethodontidae is a diverse group of salamanders with most of their diversity located in North America, specifically east of the Great Plains in the United States, along the West Coast of the United States, and in the mountainous ranges of central and southern Mexico. Two genera, Aneides and Plethodon, have representatives both on the West Coast and east of the Great Plains, regions which are seperated by wide expanses of highly unsuitable habitat for Plethodontids, which lack lungs and require constant moisture to breathe. Even more surprisingly, a single species in each genus is also present in isolated mountain ranges in New Mexico (Aneides hardii and Plethodon neomexicanus); similar, seemingly-suitable habitat is present in other nearby mountain ranges in New Mexico, and much more extensively in the Colorado Rockies to the north and the Sierra Madre Occidental to the southwest, yet neither genus has been documented in these areas in spite of extensive collecting by herpetologists. Plethodon and Aneides are each believed to be monophyletic, and they are not believed to be sister taxa, yet no other genus in Plethodontidae is present in more than one of the three hotspots described above (eastern US, West Coast, southern/central Mexico), and no Plethodontids at all are found west of central Texas and the Great Plains, and east of the Great Basin and the Idaho Rockies.
The goal of my project is to answer the question, What is the evolutionary history of these two oddly-distributed genera? Specifically, I would like to verify that Aneides and Plethodon are truly each monophyletic as they are currently understood to be, and if they are, I would like to understand how each genus expanded across North America.

To do this, I would like to construct a phylogeny containing representatives of each of Aneides and Plethodon from all 3 parts of their range. Ideally, I would like to include outgroups from other Plethodontid genera in all 3 of the hotspots described above, to potentially shed light on the origin region of each of Plethodon and Aneides.
The methods I will use to construct this phylogeny are that I will use publicly available genetic data for members of Aneides and Plethodon, along with outgroups as described above. I have briefly looked at NCBI and GenBank, and it seems like there is ample data present for members of Aneides and Plethodon from all 3 isolated regions where they occur. I would then likely use methods similar to the ones showcased in problem set 5 to construct a phylogeny; if there is more than one DNA sequence available for members of the two genera from all 3 regions and for outgroups, then I would like to look into more complicated methods we have not yet covered in class i.e. combining phylogenies obtained from multiple different genes/DNA sequences. Once I have a phylogeny, I would be able to answer the question of whether Aneides and Plethodon are each monophyletic as we currently understand them to be. My ability to answer the remaining questions would depend on what my phylogeny looked like. For example, if I found Plethodon neomexicanus to be deeply nested within a clade of western Plethodon species, I could conclude that P. neomexicanus is a relic of a dispersal event from the West Coast, seperate from the event allowing Plethodon to colonize one coast from the other. If I instead found Plethodon neomexicanus to lie within a clade of Plethodontids native to Mexico, I would conclude that Plethodon neomexicanus does not belong in Plethodon at all, and that the ancestors of Plethodon neomexicanus moved north along the Sierra Madre Occidental into New Mexico.

## Methods

For the minimum viable analysis, I chose one gene with about 800 base pairs from Plethodon neomexicanus on NCBI, used blast to find the sequences for this gene in other species I selected based on my question (described further below), and created a phylogeny using IQ tree. The phylogeny includes the two species of interest, Plethodon neomexicanus and Aneides hardii, as well as solid representation of the western and eastern assemblages of each of Plethodon and Aneides, in order to give precise information about where the two species of interest fall within their genera and relative to the radiations across the United States. Additionally, the phylogeny includes two of the northernmost-ranging Plethodontids in Mexico (Aquiloeurycea galeanae and Isthamura bellii), to test whether either species of interest may have derived from a radiation north from Mexico, a few outgroups within Plethodontidae, and one outgroup (Amphiuma means) outside of Plethodontidae.

## Results

The minimum viable analysis phylogeny described in the methods is stored in the file MinViableAnalysis/MVA_Phylogeny.pdf .

## Discussion

This phylogeny places Plethodon neomexicanus as nested within the clade of western Plethodon. This would suggest that Plethodon neomexicanus arose in its current distribution as a result of a radiation from the northwestern United States that occurred after (and seperately from) the dispersal event of Plethodon from one coast to the other. The phylogeny places Aneides hardii as sister to all western Aneides species, with Aneides aeneus, the one eastern Aneides sampled, placed as sister to all other Aneides. This suggests that Aneides hardii is the product of a radiation from the west coast that occurred after the split between Aneides aeneus and the western members of Aneides. In short, this preliminary analysis suggests that neither species is the relic of the dispersal event which allowed each of the two genera to exist on both coasts. The topology of small subclades of the tree close to the tips pretty closely matches that of published phylogenies of Plethodontidae (e.g. http://ibdev.mcb.berkeley.edu/labs/wake/373_multigenic_Plethodontidae.pdf and https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Combined-data-Plethodon-phylogeny-Phylogeny-of-the-salamander-genus-Plethodon-based-on-a_fig1_51717349), meaning that it's placement of Plethodon neomexicanus and Aneides hardii within the western clade of Plethodon and within Aneides respectively may be trusted to some degree.

This phylogeny also suggests, more controversially, that the genus Plethodon is paraphyletic, with all eastern Plethodon falling in a clade that is sister to a large portion of Plethodontidae, including genera limited to the east coast (Desmognathus, Phaeognathus, Eurycea, Pseudotriton), the west coast (Hydromantes), and Mexico and Central America (Isthamura, Aquiloeurycea). According to this result, there was no radiation of the genus Plethodon across the United States; instead, there was a divergence between eastern Plethodon and most other Plethodontids, which some of the genera in the remaining clade dispersing across the United States or into Mexico. This not only seem less believable becuase it would require several independent massive dispresal events across varied habitat and large distances, but it also goes against published family-level phylogenies of Plethodontidae. I suspect that ~800 base pairs is not sufficient to work out the order of the ancient and rapid series of divergences which resulted in the present-day (genus-level, if we are to belive current taxonomy) diversity of Plethodontidae. Going forward, I will search for more genes for which there is available data for Plethodon neomexicanus and Aneides hardii, preferably with many more base pairs, in order to construct a more certain phylogeny. I will also think about how I could make more concious choices about the model I use to gain more reliable results.
